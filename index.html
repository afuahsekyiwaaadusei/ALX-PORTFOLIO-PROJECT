        <h2>Fun fact</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
            Kai-awase (貝合わせ) is a traditional shell game with origins in Japan.
            The interior of the shells featured <br>elaborate paintings, often representing scenes from traditional Japanese literature. 
            The aim of the game <br>was to find the other half that would fit. Many games were later developed based on it.
