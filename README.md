Computer’s turn: The computer will predict your next move and make its move accordingly.
Win, lose, or draw: The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty cells.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all nine cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
AI Prediction
The computer checks all possible winning combinations to see if the new move can result in a win else it checks if there's a possible winning combination for the player and moves to block that win. Else it places a move at the first non-empty cell.
